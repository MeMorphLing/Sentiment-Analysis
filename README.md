# Sentiment-Analysis
 Binary text classification task.
Objective:
The goal of this task is to build a neural network model to perform binary text classification, where the model classifies text sequences into one of two categories.

Steps Involved:

Data Preparation:
   Simulate Data: Generate sample data for training and testing.
   Tokenization: Convert text sequences into numerical form using tokenization.
   Padding: Ensure all sequences have the same length by padding shorter sequences.
   
Model Architecture:
   Embedding Layer: Converts input text sequences into dense vectors of fixed size.
   LSTM Layers: Capture the sequential dependencies in the text data.
   Dropout Layers: Prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 during training.
   Dense Layer: Output layer with a sigmoid activation function to produce a binary output.
   
Model Compilation:
   Loss Function: Use Binary Crossentropy to measure the performance of the model.
   Optimizer: Use Adam optimizer for efficient training.
   Metrics: Track accuracy during training and evaluation.
   
Training the Model:
   Split the data into training and validation sets.
   Train the model on the training data and validate it on the validation set.
   Use Early Stopping to prevent overfitting by monitoring the validation loss.
   
Model Evaluation:
   Evaluate the model's performance on the test data.
   Visualize the training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs to understand the model's learning process.
   
Visualization:
   Accuracy Plot: Shows how the accuracy changes over epochs for both training and validation sets.
   Loss Plot: Displays the loss values over epochs for both training and validation sets.
   Bar Plot: Visualizes the distribution of target labels in the dataset.
   
Key Points:
   The task involves sequential data processing, making LSTM layers suitable due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies.
   Proper regularization techniques such as Dropout and Early Stopping are used to enhance the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
   Visualization of training progress helps in diagnosing potential issues like overfitting or underfitting.
   
Applications:
   Sentiment analysis, spam detection, document classification, and other binary text classification problems.
